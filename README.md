# license_plate_detection
This is a final project for the course Machine Vision in detecting license plates. Reading vehicles plate numbers is a technology which very useful in security and traffic control. Image processing using machine vision is the best way to make Reading vehicles plate numbers program. Edge detection is used to make gray scale image so it can more easily to read the plate numbers. Canny Edge Detection is the best method to detect the edge of the object. This Canny Edge Detection will be more effective if we are using Sliding Window method to detect the location of the object and MLP method to train the program so it can classify the plate number or not plate number without worrying with the noise and blurring.

For the full report of the project, please refer to [License Plate Detection Using Sliding Window Method](Report.pdf)
